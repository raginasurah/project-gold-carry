# üîí Security & Privacy

## Sensitive Data Handling

This application has been designed with security best practices in mind. All sensitive information has been removed from the codebase and replaced with placeholder values.

### ‚úÖ What's Been Secured

#### **API Keys & Secrets**
- ‚úÖ **OpenAI API Key**: Removed from all files, replaced with `your-openai-api-key-here`
- ‚úÖ **JWT Secret Key**: Replaced with `your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production`
- ‚úÖ **Database Passwords**: Replaced with `user:password@localhost/dbname`
- ‚úÖ **SMTP Passwords**: Replaced with `your-app-password`

#### **Environment Variables**
All sensitive environment variables are properly configured as placeholders:

```bash
# Backend (.env)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password

# Frontend (.env.local)
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

### üîß How to Configure

#### **For Development**
1. Copy `env.example` to `.env` in the backend directory
2. Copy `env.example` to `.env.local` in the frontend directory
3. Replace placeholder values with your actual credentials

#### **For Production**
1. **Railway Backend**: Set environment variables in Railway dashboard
2. **Vercel Frontend**: Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. **Never commit actual API keys** to version control

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

#### **Authentication**
- JWT token-based authentication
- Secure token storage in localStorage
- Token expiration handling
- Password validation and hashing

#### **API Security**
- CORS properly configured
- Rate limiting implemented
- Input validation with Pydantic
- Error handling without exposing sensitive data

#### **Data Protection**
- HTTPS for all communications
- Environment variable management
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- Secure password handling

### üìã Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Replace all placeholder API keys with real values
- [ ] Generate a strong JWT secret key
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins
- [ ] Set up HTTPS certificates
- [ ] Configure database with strong passwords
- [ ] Set up proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Review and update security headers
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Verify no secrets are logged

### üö® Important Notes

1. **Never commit API keys** to Git repositories
2. **Use environment variables** for all sensitive data
3. **Regularly rotate** API keys and secrets
4. **Monitor** for unauthorized access
5. **Keep dependencies** updated for security patches

### üîç Security Monitoring

- Monitor API usage for unusual patterns
- Log authentication attempts
- Track failed login attempts
- Monitor for CORS violations
- Check for rate limit violations

### üìû Security Contact

If you discover any security vulnerabilities, please:
1. Do not publicly disclose the issue
2. Contact the development team privately
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for fixes before disclosure
